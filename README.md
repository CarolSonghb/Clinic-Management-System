**Clinic System**  

--------------------------------------------------------

*This project is written in python, and used Tkinter as its GUI*  
*This is a straightforward clinic management system where you can:*
1. View lists of Patients and Doctors
2. Assign a patient to a doctor. If the patient you are assigning has been previous assigned a doctor, the new doctor will replace the old one. A doctor can have multiple patients.
3. Add consultation details (date/reason/fee) for a doctor and a patient, but that doesn't assign them to each other.
4. Search a patient or a doctor by their names.
5. View detailed infomation of a patient or a doctor selected. (If assigned/Consultation list/Fees due)
6. View consultation report (A list of all consultation of the clinic)
